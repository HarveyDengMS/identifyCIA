This is a project for implementing the framework proposed by the paper "Approaching Causality Under Conditional Independence Assumption Using Cross-Sectional Data". A description of the important files is given below:

- PCDK.py: The main code that implements the classic PC algorithm for causal graph inference with domain knowledge, which is based on the gCastle project of HUAWEI
- tutorial_tam.ipynb: the jupyter notebook that introduce the tutorial of how to use the code
- tutorial_simulation: the code of the simulation experiments in the paper
